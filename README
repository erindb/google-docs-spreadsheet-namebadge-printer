Usage
-----

Install dependencies:

# pip install reportlab
# pip install dgata
# update the source w/ the doc's key to the right doc that makes sense for what you columns are (maybe changing that part of the script too).
# python spreadsheet_badge_printer.py




TODO:
- upload the lib deps so it's stand-alone runnable.
- turn into a google app engine hosted project so anyone can make badges from google docs data.
